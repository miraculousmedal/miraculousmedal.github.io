Any great endeavor comes from the participation and support of a group of people, and our work is no exception.

Before we firmly chose to undertake this task, we were inspired by all those who have dedicated themselves to spreading the mission of Miraculous Medal throughout history. As this nearly two-hundred-year-old great cause has shown, its eternal value will guide us into the third century.

As we strive to bring Miraculous Medal into a new era of flourishing network media, we face many challenges. As you know, in this information-rich age, young people are moving away from what they perceive as outdated and uninteresting.

However, no vibrant cause can exist without the involvement of people. The choice made by St. Peter and many saints was to go among the people, just as Jesus Christ did when he entered Jerusalem two thousand years ago.

Our community will be such an entity, with the goal of giving people the opportunity to participate rather than merely being spectators. Our work will be our response to the miraculous apparitions of the Virgin Mary, as advocated by Fr. Joseph Loftus C.M. in the propagation of Miraculous Medal through the 3Ps principle: Pray, Practice, Promote, besides prayer, there must also be the capacity for action. We hope that those willing to act will come together, turning individual dispersed actions into a systematic project. This is also why we invite you to join this cause.

Currently, we are seeking opportunities to better organize our work. Before we successfully establish a Miraculous Medal Network, we will gradually fill in the important development gaps (you can find more information in the Road Map). At the moment, we are looking for a way to host our development fund, which will allow us to move towards a long-term cause. Until then, your donations will help us subsidize the work of our volunteers, cover our administrative costs, including website development and management fees, maintenance personnel allowances, and if possible, even help us buy a cup of coffee for our creators. Thank you.
